I finally finished a ready-for-manufacturing version which fixes all the issues of the prototype.
Since all the issues were on the mainboard, I only sent that one to production to verify it works.

Here are the [production files](production.zip) for manufacturing at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/).

And here is [the schematic](schematic.pdf).

Read the "README" files in the [previous blog post](https://blog.glowtimer.com/2024-05-16/prototype-design-files/) for more instructions.

If you actually do make it, shoot me an [email](mailto:glowtimer@rico.live),
I'll be happy to answer any questions!

Cheers!
